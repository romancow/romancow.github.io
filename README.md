Hello! My name is **Sean Wilson**, and I am a software engineer in Nashville, TN (USA).

This GitHub project is for my online résumé. Feel free to take a look at https://seanwilson.dev, and then [hire me](mailto:contact@seanwilson.dev).

## How It Works

Instead of making just your typical, static résumé page, I decided to get a bit more "open source" and build it using [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) with a custom-made theme.

*(Learn more about my personal résumé theme and how it works [here](https://github.com/romancow/jsonresume-theme-swilson).)*

This project uses my custom theme, the [Resumed](https://github.com/rbardini/resumed) library, and my [résumé JSON gist](https://gist.github.com/romancow/e37b9c031c0924bc67a43c1273010c65) (as a submodule) to render and publish the final product to GitHub Pages.

Since the résumé JSON is a separate gist, it also works with the JSON Resume [hosting service](https://jsonresume.org/getting-started) and both can be updated in unison. Check it out there with their alternative themes: https://registry.jsonresume.org/romancow?theme=elegant
